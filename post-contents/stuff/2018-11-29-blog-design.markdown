I've been planning on giving my blog a visual redesign for a few months now. However, I'm having trouble deciding what I actually want it to look like. I have two conflicting ideas for the theme: something warm and fuzzy (like Eevee's [Fuzzy Notepad](https://eev.ee/blog/)) or something raw and efficient (like [Dan Luu's blog](http://danluu.com/)). I like both of these styles very much, so instead of expending effort to make that difficult decision now, I'll ask anyone who reads this post to send me an email (or, if I know you personally and linked you to this page, contact me through Discord or whatever) describing (1) what they value in a blog's visual appearance (2) what they think my blog should look like and (3) what they think of the following blog themes:

 - [Matt Might](http://matt.might.net/)
 - [Jacques Mattheij](https://jacquesmattheij.com/)
 - [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)
 - [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com/blog/)
 - [Dan Luu](http://danluu.com/)
 - [Eevee](https://eev.ee/blog/)
 - [Rachel by the Bay](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/)
 - [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/)
 - [Mike Eash](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/)

I have three desires for my blog: technological efficiency (low data transfer and fast rendering times, which means mostly-static content), content efficiency (the reader should be able to find and consume information relatively quickly - so putting the entire content of every article on the front page is a huge no-no - instead, the article titles and at *most* a one-paragraph summary (ideally only a single line) should be shown), and a feeling of "warmth" or "coziness". Part of said warm feeling will come from the content, which is my job - I would love advice on how to get the visual appearance to display coziness, though!
