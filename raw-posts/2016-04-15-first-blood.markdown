Greetings. This is the blog of Fouric. Hopefully, this is where I will post my discoveries on my journey toward becoming a fully-fledged Lisp hacker. If you're a friend of mine, then you know who I am and can needle me about the content of this blog in real life. If you don't know me, but have discovered this blog and find it interesting, then it will be a thing that you check every month or two. If you found this blog from a Google search due to an obscure problem, then I hope that I can help you; if you wish, then you can email me at the address at the bottom of this page and hope that I respond. I'm usually quite amiable about answering questions about the material that I post here, so you might as well give it a shot.
