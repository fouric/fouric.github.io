My blog. Very much work-in-progress. My goal is to build an attractive, functional blog that contains a variety of interesting and useful content on several sub-fields of technology that I'm interested in. We'll see if I ever get there, but I will make an attempt, and I certainly do not plan on making a promotion-only or useless-trivial-tutorials site.
