In my efforts to teach others how to program, I have found that beginners commonly mix up the ideas of "variables" and "values", resulting in a fair amount of confusion and frustration. I have even come across people who think they are the same thing if they don't think very hard about it. This is probably in part because programming is so *alien* to humans; itâ€™s a whole different category of task. In any case, if you want your beginning programmers to succeed, define your terms as clearly as possible and resolve any ambiguities, *especially* this one.
