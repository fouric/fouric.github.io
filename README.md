# fouric.github.io

My blog. Very much work-in-progress. My goal is to build an attractive, functional blog that contains a variety of interesting and useful content on several sub-fields of technology that I'm interested in. We'll see if I ever get there, but I will make an attempt, and I certainly do not plan on making a promotion-only or useless-trivial-tutorials site.

## quickstart

Check out https://github.com/fouric/fouric.github.io/blob/master/src/index.lisp for the code I'm currently playing around with to generate HTML!

## deficiencies

Doesn't handle paths correctly/at all - links to assets and pages are hardcoded.
